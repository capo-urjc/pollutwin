Research project consisting of the development and integration of both artificial vision and machine learning tools, as well as different computational fluid dynamics models, all of them aimed at the design of a high-fidelity Digital Twin for the transport of polluting agents as support for the of decisions in the context of the green transition of cities. This project is being carried out by two high-performance research groups
